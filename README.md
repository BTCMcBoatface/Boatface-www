Here's the recommended steps from Claude:

I'll help you plan out this website project. Here's a high-level plan broken down into logical phases:

Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Create a new repository named `yourusername.github.io` for GitHub Pages
3. Set up your local development environment (code editor, Git)
4. Clone the repository to your local machine

Phase 2: Website Development
1. Create the basic structure:
   - index.html as the main entry point
   - css folder for stylesheets
   - js folder (if needed) for JavaScript files
   - assets folder for images and other media
2. Develop the site content and design
3. Test locally
4. Push changes to GitHub

Phase 3: GitHub Pages Setup
1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
2. Choose the main branch as your source
3. Verify the site is working at yourusername.github.io

Phase 4: Custom Domain Setup
1. Add your custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
2. Configure DNS records at your domain provider:
   - Create a CNAME record pointing to yourusername.github.io
   - Or set up A records pointing to GitHub's IP addresses
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
4. Verify HTTPS is working (GitHub will automatically secure your site)

Would you like to proceed with Phase 1, or do you have any questions about this plan? Also, it would be helpful to know:
- Do you already have a GitHub account?
- What's your comfort level with HTML/CSS?
- What kind of website are you building (portfolio, business, blog, etc.)?
